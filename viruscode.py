# Count all substitutions (AT, AC, AG, GC, GA, GT, TA, TC, TC, CA, CG, CT) compared to ref for all seqs and put name and

# The sum of each different substitutions divided with the number of unique sequences from the respective dates

# Substitution frequency of each type of substitutions on each date into csv file

# Make graph of substitution frequency of all possible substitutions for all dates
