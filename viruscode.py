# Align sequences to ref

# Count all substitutions (AT, AC, AG, GC, GA, GT, TA, TC, TC, CA, CG, CT) compared to ref for all seqs

# Pair substitution results from each seq with date for each seq in the metadata csv file

# All substitutions divided with number of sequences from that date

# How much substitution on each date

# Make graph of substitution frequency certain dates
